# sonolus-psekai-engine

A recreation of Project Sekai engine in Sonolus.

This is a temporary fork of the original engine created by LeptailurusServal, aims to provide update for latest Sonolus version, until a complete rewrite of the engine can be made.

Please see the [original repo](https://github.com/LeptailurusServal/sonolus-psekai-engine) for more information.
